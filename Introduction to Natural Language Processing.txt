Introduction to Natural Language Processing
===========================================

Week 1

Introduction 1/2

NLP is the study of the computational treatment of natural (human) language.

Computers to understand (and generate) human language.

Modern application:
Search engines
Question Answering (IBM's Watson)
Natural language assistants (Siri)
Translation Systems (Google Translate)
News digest (Yahoo)

NLP draws on research in
a. Linguistics
b. Theoretical Computer Science
c. Mathematics
d. Statistics
e. AI
f. Psychology
g. Databases, etc.

Goals of this class:
a. Understand that language processing is hard.
b. Understand they key problems in NLP.
c. Learn about the methods used to address these problems.
d. Understand the limitations of these methods.

Language and Communication:
a. Speaker
- Intention (goal, shared knowledge, and beliefs)
- Generation (tactical)
- Synthesis (text or speech)

b. Listener
- Perception
- Interpretation (syntactic, semantic, pragmatic)
- Incorporation (internalization, understanding)

c. Both
- Context (grounding)

Basic NLP Pipeline:
(U)ndestanding & (G)eneration
Language ---- (U) ---> Computer --- (G) ----> Language

Genres of Text:
Blogs, emails, press releases, chat, debates, etc
Scientific research papers, fiction books, Poetry

Ambiguous nature of sentences results in NLP hard problems.
a. Lexical Ambiguity
b. Structural Ambiguity
c. Scope Ambiguity

Structure of the course:
a. Four major parts.
	i. Linguistic, mathematical, and computational background.
	ii. Computational models of morphology, syntax, semantics, discourse, pragmatics.
	iii. Core NLP technology: parsing, POS tagging, text generation, etc.
	iv. Applications: text classification, machine translation, information extraction, etc

b. Three major goals
	i. Learn the basic principles and theoretical issues underlying NLP.
	ii. Learn techniques and tools used to develop practical, robust systems.
	iii. Gain insight into some open research problems in NLP.

Why NLP is hard?
Metaphorical sentences are hard for NLP
For e.g Time flies like an arrow.

Common sense is hard for NLP machines
For e.g Each American has a mother. (Multiple mothers)
Each American has a president. (Single president)

Syntax error
* Little a has Mary lamb.

Semantic error
? Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.

Ambigous words.

Others ambiguity:
Morphological ambiguity (Structure of a sentence)
Phonetic ambiguity
Part of Speech
Syntactic
PP attachment
Sense
Modality
Subjectivity
CC attachment
Negation
Referential
Reflexive
Ellipsis and parallelism
Metonympy (the substitution of the name of an attribute or adjunct for that of the thing meant)

Other Sources of Difficulties:
Non-standard, slang, and novel words
Complex sentences
Humor and sarcasm
Absense of world knowledge
Semantics and pragmatics

Synonyms and Paraphrases

Most of the ambiquity are fairly common sense, which computers doesn't posses.

Linguistic knowledge:
a. Constituents
For e.g Children eat pizza or They eat pizza.

b. Collocations
For e.g red wine, but not brown wine

How to get this knowledge in the system:
- Manual rules
- Automatic acquire from large text collections (corpora)

Knowledge about language:
a. Phonetics and phonology: the study of sound
b. Morphology: the study of word components
c. Syntax: the study of sentence and phrase structure
d. Lexical semantics: the study of meanings of words
e. Compositional semantics: how to combine words
f. Pragmatics: how to accomplish goals
g. Discourse conventions: how to deal with units larger than utterances

How to store language knowledge:
Finite-state automata
Grammars
Complexity
Dynamic Programming

Mathematics and Statistics:
Probability
Statistical Models
Hypothesis testing
Linear algebra
Optimization
Numerical methods

Mathematical and Computational tools:
Language models
Estimation methods
Context-free Grammar (CFG)
Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
Generative/discriminative models
Maximum entropy models

Statistical Techniques:
Vector space representation for WSD
Noisy channel models for MT
Graph-based Random walk methods for sentiment analysis

Aritficial Intelligence:
Logic
Agents
Planning
Constraint satisfaction
Machine learning

Linguistics:
IPA Chart for language pronouncation
Languages are related, all derived from Proto-Indo-European Langauge (PIE)

Language changes over time.

Diversity of languages:
Absence of Articles
Cases
Sound systems
Social status

NACLO Problems

Language Universals:
Unconditional and conditional types of universals; common in all languages.
